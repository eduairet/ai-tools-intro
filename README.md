# AI Tools Intro

AI Tools Overview

- Even though there are a lot of AI tools out there, some of the most popular are:
  - **GitHub Copilot:** AI-Assistant extension with autocomplete capabilities, and more recently agent mode.
  - **Cursor AI:** AI-First Code Editor that allows you to generate multi-file code with AI.
  - **ChatGPT:** Chatbot that uses AI to answer general purpose questions, and can also be used to generate code.

## Prompt Engineering Tips

- **Be Specific:** The more specific you are with your request, the better the response will be. Instead of asking "How do I write a function?", ask "How do I write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number?".
- **Use Examples:** If you're looking for a specific format or style, provide examples in your prompt. This helps the AI understand what you're looking for.
- **Iterate:** If the first response isn't what you expected, refine your prompt and try again (don't get into an infinite loop here). AI tools learn from feedback, so iterating on your prompts can lead to better results.
- **Use Context:** Provide context for your request. If you're asking for code, mention the programming language, libraries, or frameworks you're using.
- **Ask for Explanations:** If you're unsure about a response, ask the AI to explain its reasoning or provide more details. This can help you understand the solution better.
- **Break Down Complex Requests:** If your request is complex, break it down into smaller, manageable parts. This makes it easier for the AI to provide accurate responses.
- **Use Clear Language:** Avoid jargon or ambiguous terms. Use clear and concise language to ensure the AI understands your request.
- **Always Review Responses:** AI-generated responses may not always be accurate or complete. Always review the responses and make necessary adjustments before using them in your code or projects.
- **Don't overuse AI:** While AI tools can be incredibly helpful, they are not a replacement for understanding the underlying concepts. Use them as a supplement to your knowledge, not a crutch, and also avoid using them for everything, as they can lead to over-reliance and reduced problem-solving skills.
